This week I added a crash display, so that the game enters a "blue screen" instead
of crashing. At first I used my own built in debug print but then I replaced it with
the much nicer dear imgui display. I also moved my duktape wrapper to core and
started reasearching into replacing dukglue with a custom much simpler system.
