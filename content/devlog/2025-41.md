This week I mostly worked on visual debug and I think that is going to take another week. So... while I won't complete arcade racer game this year, I think a (new) worthy goal is to at least complete the renderer, along with a extremly rough "proof of concept" asset importer so that I can perhaps buy some sweat new assets for the end of the year sales that always seems to pop up.
