This week I continued on euphoria argparser, adding a custom parser for non-standard elements. I started on running clang-tidy and clang-format on all the code, but it's not done yet. I may end up adding a few options to clang-format so it can work with my code style, we'll see. I also manage to uncover a old codestat project. A project intended to run on your codebase and gather statistics over time. It's still in the early days, so let's see how that goes.
