This week I mostly spend either watching netflix movies or coding on
euphoria/spaceyper. One of my new year resolutions is to complete a few projects,
including fish hunt, space typer and star collector. Of all the projects fish hunt
is the one that is most completed. Star collector comes second but that is an
android project so releasing that is another project entirly. Until next week.
