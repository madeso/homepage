Almost end of the year, I didn't work on instancing but I did some big changes in euphoria. I "removed" pretty much everything and started refactoring the base project. I bumped the unbuntu CI builder and with the new linter comes a new list of warnings to fix or silence. When that is done I can start working on the new dear imgui based editor app with undo/redo support, at least until the 3d rendering is "done". My goal before the end of the year is to finally complete the instancing.
