This week, last year, I started replacing the depndency on external coverage reports by also publishing the html report. The next year I continued with showing a the code city of the current euphoria and displaying the clang-tidy warnings on the demo html page. I also caught a fever that I'm recovring from so that's perhaps why I haven't worked on instancing, maybe next week... :)
