This week I copied the script used to create the 'game programming patterns' book and rewrote most of it to be generic instead of tied to a specific book. Apperently it didn't support ebook generation so I'll probably add that eventually. The rest of the week was spent on reading up on engine design and some refactoring of tred so no new major features.
