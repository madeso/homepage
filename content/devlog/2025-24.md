This week started out with me adding code generation support to glox but transitioned back to kotter when I was told that my problem could be solved by the debug output extension and that my usage has been broken since 2017. After I fixed that issue glox was less interesting and so I actually just continued working on klotter and completed the anti aliasing task, so next week I'll continue with the cleanup task and perhaps start on gamma correction.
