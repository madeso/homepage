This week I continued on altdev, getting really close to having the text of all posts now. Extracting tags and categories is up next. Genesis is also comming along nicely. Copying the public documentation the doxygen comments I realize that reading detailed comments is nice, even though the comments aren't exactly helping it is sometimes nice having some comments to look at when pulling hair out trying to figure out a problem. I'm not sure if that's a good enough argument in keeping them around but...
The final project I worked on this week is actually a new one, one that I found when reading altdev. It's a documentation system and currently most of the work is converting the ruby code to c# and me trying to understand it. Perhaps I'm having second thoughs about doxygen... we'll see what happens and how it turns out in the comming weeks...
