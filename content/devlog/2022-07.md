This week I started writing on the blog post that will become the second chapter of "clean code". Should be up sometimes next week. I spent most of the weekend with running clang-tidy and porting my clang-tidy script to workbench, mostly because I wanted a html report now that I've seen how pretty the header hero report looks :)
