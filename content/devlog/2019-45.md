This week I added basic cp437 functions to euph and refactored the current font to use the utf8 character encoding instead of some unspecified encoding that looked like ascii. I moved some part of the rendering to core and replaced the rendering text on image with the "new" core font instead of just the single built in font. With the increased intrest in text rendering/drawing with text and cp437 I looked into implementing part of the figlet specification, so that might happen. Finnaly I deceded to start pushing some fel code, even though it's not working. I'm working on it and I still hope to have a fully working parser and vm before the start of december. I think that's about it for now.
