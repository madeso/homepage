This week I continued work on fyro. I finally completed the code restructuring and stared doing some small changes, now inheritance support inheriting from classes in namespaces, how about that? I did a rough breakdown of object/object collision and what needs to happen before I can actually start writing code for it and that ball will start rolling next week.
