The only read progress I made this  week was adding blinn-phong specular rendering to klotter. I also spent time figuring out how to expand the current system to add gamma correction and HDR/bloom rendering and when to transform between the linear and the gamma color spaces. Next week will hopefully be the time that I'll implement it.
