This week I completed the bfxr installations so that the build generates a installer and uploads it so people can use it, unfortunatly it looks like it doesn't work so I have to investigate why. I also spent some time on euphoria making the vector/point refactor compile and I started a test if lua is a better scripting engine than js. So far I am not convinced.
