This week I didn't do much dev. I went to a C++ talk and while it wasn't as interesting as I hoped, it got me thinking. Why am I using C++14? I based my decision on that I want to port my engine to android and I discovered that they have now moved to C++17! So in the near future I will update my whole library to use 17. Yay!
