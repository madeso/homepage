This week I forgot my plan and bought some 3d assets on a black-friday sale so I've spent most, if not all, of my time integrating my level editor t3d into euphoria and trying to make it usable. I've fixed so that it loads the tile meshes and I'm currently adding collision detecion so I can add selection and interaction. Until next time.
