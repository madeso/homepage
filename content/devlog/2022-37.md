This week I added texture, sprite animation and started on 2d "pixel perfect" collision detection to fyro. This required me to start adding support for scripting classes to inherit from native classes and that is what I'm currently laying the finishing touches on. Hopefully by the end of next week I have some basic 2d topdown and platformer collision going on.
