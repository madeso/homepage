This week I mostly spent on binge watching Agents of Shield (again), and did some real world stuff, however I decided that I'd want to use my own 3d engine
for my next game jam, so I spent a significant part of the weekend on this engine. I'm hoping that it will be in a useful state for the Kenney jam on a month.
