This week I sent another email to Mike Acton about my flipcode clone, hoping this results in a better response than twitter DM (:/) otherwise I mmostly worked on flipcode. I was going to get back into rendering but for one reason or another it didn't happen this weekend either. Perhaps next week. I'm really keen on working on the arcade car game.
