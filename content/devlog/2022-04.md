This week I mostly wrote a blog post about Clean Code Chapter 2. I found a project called Header Hero that I might incorporate into my own header tool and started to refactor euphoria core library so I can get a better flow/structure and in preparation of the introduction of PCHs. Hopefully all will get the compilation times down to some form manageable levels.
