This week I ported the last python script (I think) and continued working on cleaning up the build code. Then I started a new project (oh noes), a small(ish) static site generator. It started, at first, as a small project to see how big a static static site generator would be but I think, if it ever becomes useful, it would be neat if I could port this homepage/blog to use it. I know I missed a few features in hugo when I wrote the first version of this page, and if they are not present when my generator is "done", then perhaps it's a good idea to switch :)
