This week I did some small fixes in blaggen and continued work on the anim project. I'm about to start reading chapter 9 of 15 and implementing chapter 8 so with any luck the anim project is soon finished and the knowledge from that can be applied to the kloter project... and speaking of klotter, I really should just continue working on it and actually complete a render project once.
