This week I was back at work, and the weekend was spent on real life stuff and working on a entry for the Kenney game jam. While I did work on the entry I ran out of time before I could finish the game. Since it was based on a previous project of mine I have inteded to finish but didn't for various reasons I'm gonna consider this a start for actually finishing that game.
