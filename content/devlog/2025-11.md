This week I mostly watched star trek. I did some small things on euph and made the FSE, full screen effect, optional. After sleeping on it, and thinking about it for a day I probably going to remove the option to toggle the FSE
as it didn'tappear to  affect loading time as much as I thought it would, and the if complicates a already complicated code base. March and April is supposed to be when I work on the 3d rendering and to that end I did look at instancing again and I now think that it will be easier to implement than I initially thought, perhaps I'm going to get it done next week ...if I don't spend so much time watching star trek :D
