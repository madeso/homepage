This week I got sidetracked and started to look into ubiquity, but even worse I think I took the wrong approach when starting to add types and trying to understand the code. Now I think the best way is to get a version running first before I start adding types ... but that will probably not be next week. I both need and want to get back to euphoria and klotter.
