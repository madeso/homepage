This was a little bit better. I watched a little bit of netflix, but converted the current deploy script from bash to python
so I, in the future, can add more advanced image rezising functions that hugo currently doesnt support. Then I pretty much
started the konmari appartment cleanup so I guess I wont get much development stuff done for a couple of weeks.
