This week I didn't do much. Besides a few commits here and there I mostly just relaxed after the spelsylt gamejam. I completed season 1 of Star Trek - The original series and realized I should probably create a list of the best episodes for each star trek series + season I've watched so I can recall the good episodes if I feel I need to watch some good star trek again.
