This week I implemented the IK to my vita animation testbed. I think this marks the project as "completed". There still is chapters to be read but I don't think I will implement them, so I started cleaning up my animation notes. Next week will continue the klotter project and the final step is to merge the animation notes, perhaps  with some of the vite animation code into the klotter project, but first there is a lot of klotter to be done.
