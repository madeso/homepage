This week I spend to some watching videos about gui development and refactoring my old widget sizer code that I might reuse for the gui system in euphoria. Regarding klotter I basically deleted all my progress and started fresh with a readme like development and wrote the actual usage... and now I just have to implement the few functions so hopefully I won't get stuck in details this time.
