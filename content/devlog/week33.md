This week I was back on work and even though my time was more limited, I still
managed to do a little bit on the "engine". I added clang-tidy and clang-format
as a optional step in the build process. I then continued on fixing almost all the
error that clang-tidy found. That took the better part of the week. Then I added
basic lightning to the engine demo.
