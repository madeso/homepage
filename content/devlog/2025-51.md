This week I mostly watched start trek as it's disapearing from netflix in a few weeks and I'd like to complete my watching(only the last 4 season of ds9 left). Besides that, I actually managed to continue work on klotter and fix both the linux and the windows ci. Next week, while watching star trek, I'm planning to fix the warnings CI has found and do some work on the samling project.
