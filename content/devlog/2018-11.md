This week I finished up the basic javascript test that I wrote last week, and
after two days of struggling on how to design the API I just went ahead and added
the bare minimum input handling: keyboard buttons. Sooner or later I have to figure
out how I should handle joysticks, gamepads, touch controls, vr controls,
virtual buttons on touch controls etc. etc, but so far the everything is data driven, so I guess that's nice.
