This week I worked on making the dotgrid export better at lower resolutions. I also started a new project, samling, helping me determine what assets I own and if buying a new pack is worth it or not. I was planning to work on shadows but my week was was cut short with visitng familty giving me practically no weekend so shadows will have to wait yet another week :(
