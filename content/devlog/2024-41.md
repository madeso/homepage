This week I didn't do much I started reading open JK code but I spent most of the week learning "hacking for developers". I don't think I will complete it before my eval ends next week so I just have to hope I can continue the course when work gives me access again. I atleast managed to upgraded my static page generator to the latest .net lts and started thinking about perhaps completing it.
