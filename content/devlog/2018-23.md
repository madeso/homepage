This week I threw out the wx scimed/ninepatch editor and have now a improved
dear imgui version of it. There still are some non imgui like parts from the ported
code but things are looking better. I just started on the imgui extension for gaf,
and after that is completed I can work on saving json so I can close this chapter.
