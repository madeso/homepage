This week I've mostly been working on the altdev cloning. Categories are done and image cloning is almost done. It's been running for a few days nowand getting closer to completion. Downloading many images, especially if there are lots of redirects, 404s and you want to be nice to the server takes time. I am also slowly coming to the conclusion that my main engine, euphoria, has 90% yagni in it. I've always added things that I found interesting and was "game like" but it has somewhat become a behemoth without any features to speak of and I'm strongly considering going over the code and yagni/sunsetting/moving most of the code to a legacy folder until I can find a good place for it. It's working as intended but maybe that isn't enough anymore...
