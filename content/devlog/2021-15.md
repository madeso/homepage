This week I i removed the last of javascript references merged the lua branch of euphoria into master. Still a few places to clean up but I can move forward now with a better scriping engine. I am actually tempted to put all my efforts into a vertical slice of the engine so we'll see in a week if I took action or continued cleaning up the code.
