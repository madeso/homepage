This week I continued getting euph build working. clang-tidy is taking too long so that's next. I'm planning to extend workbench and run multiple clang-tidy instances. That should hopefully cut down on the analysis time.
Next up is probably replacing the coverage report. I've grown tired of online services and want something that I can run locally. For the "coveralls" experience I should make sure the result generates a badge and it can be viewed in a browser. But this task lays beond the klotter work. I really want to continue working on klotter and finish the instanced rendering task.
