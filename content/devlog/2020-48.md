This week I looked into the markov-chains parts of euphoria (again), refactored a bit and expanded with a "line" test, a bit of fun really. I also thought about how I want to lay out the vertex attributes in tred. It currently is 100% dynamic butit will be easier if it's static. A few days I ago I was sure I wanted a 50/50 approach but since I have to deal with all the dynamic issues anyway I might as well benefit from the potential space spacing and use 100% dynamic attributes. Time will tell what I'll decide.
