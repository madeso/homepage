This week I mostly worked on the poster tester project as I started using it again for work. I also came to the realization that altough I won't complete the arcade racer, I could complete the rendering engine and thus started to read up onhow to improve the display of textures in dear imgui as this will greatly improve how I can debug the shadow rendering.
