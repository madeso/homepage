This week I fixed warnings in euphoria and added implementation of tor curves. My new year resolution is that I should complete the tred project and integrate all the findings from in into euphoria and on that track I started cleaning up tred some more by splitting the headers into a public and private part. Turns out the rendering exposes some implementation details so I need to clean up the include graph tree and perhaps refactor a bit next week.
