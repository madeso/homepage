For this and last week of te last year I mostly watched Star Trek: Deep Space 9. I did some work on samling and some smaller work on klotter.

I've also been thinking about what a skeumorphic design for a "unity engine" could look like. Could each component look like a instrument in reaper with knobs and whatnot. How would that be written in code? What widgets are needed? That sort of thing. Perhaps I'll make a prototype or something, [colorpalette.pro](https://colorpalette.pro/) is some sort of inspiration.
