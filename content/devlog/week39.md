This week I started on rewriting ride in rust. From the ground up. I have some
really basic custom input control in the GTK build, but I'll need to get a proper
text rendering system up before I can continue. I also started working on a
3d level editor that I need for any game. Not much progress as I just grabbed
the demo application and started removing things from it.
