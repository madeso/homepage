This week I continued work on the altdev archive. I gave up trying to use pandoc and currently use tidy to convert html to xhtml that can then easily be parsed(mostly) using a regular xml structure. The output is about as good as can be expected when the html is kinda broken but the result is far better than what I had with pandoc. A few weeks more and I think I'm done with markdown generation
