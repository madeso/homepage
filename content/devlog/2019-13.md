This week I continued on my arch config quest. I updated my aur tool to be able to write updated dependencies per install instead of globally. It now also can tell the git commits between when you last wrote and the latest. I started writing a tool to create a new localized mirrors file based on the official one. Finally I started writing on a simple script to extract pngs at various resolutions from a svg file.
