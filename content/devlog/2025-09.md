This week I replaced all external code analysis and code coverage tools for euphoria and finally replaced them with tools that are run locally.
Since March has started I should move on to the next "sprint" but I really want to get a 100% function coverage. The start of the next sprint is completing the klotter project so technically
I can work on both, at least until the klotter project is complete so that's most likely what I'm going to do. Until next time...
