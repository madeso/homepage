This week I finished watching the anim talk and I finished reading the Ik part of the animation book. Next week I'll clean up and understand the IK code and cleaning up my animation notes. After that it's back to klotterfinish up rendering so I can implement all of the animation on top of it, but that is further away than next week, so until then...
