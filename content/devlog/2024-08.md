This week I accidentally commited to euphoria repo and for some reason all the builds started failing, so I worked on fixing them, including updating to the latest catch and the latest compiler that is installed on the runners. Next week I'm going to do some basic workbench things to fix more build issues and then 100% focus on klotter ignoring the euph build errors.
