This week I relaxed from the kodsnack spelsylt gamejam. Apprently I came third, so yay me. I also started on my own scripting language called fel. A mix between typescript and lua. I'm gonna try and apply the same commtiment I used for the kodsylt, that is lets see how much I can acchieve during 2 weeks.
