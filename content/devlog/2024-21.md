This week I continued working on my altdevblog cloner. I started integrating multiple indexings. I currently merge 3 different timestamps but will probably increase to some more as there is still articles I'm missing. I also mostly completed the genesis transformation. It didn't contain what I was orignally looking for so I will probably have to expand to include the extensions I was using and I am in luck because I've saved everything :D
