This week I basically just went through the entire list of errors that clang-tidy
can detect and decided what to use, and what to ignore, and fixed several warnings.
Then I continued workin on my protobuf replacement library, gaf, that I started ages ago.
Hopefully within a week or two I can replace protobuf in euphoria soon.
