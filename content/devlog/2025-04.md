This week I continued on workbench dependency injection and finally managed to run a simple clang-tidy as part of a unit/integration test. On euphoria side I continued on cleaning up the code. I discovered a way to run regex on strings so I'm probably going to take advantage of that when I implement 100% function coverage later on. I finally did a little bit of planning and decided that the cleanup process should last at maximum to the end of february. Pretty realistic goal, I think, and hopefully I can finish it before then.
