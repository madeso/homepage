This week I finished the rewatch of Bobbys entity talk and fixed typos so that my notes compile. I'll probably will soon start integrating it into euphoria. Speaking of euphoria I also started cleaning up the code based on suggestions by the tool I hacked together last week and I'm almost done cleaning up the code. When that's done I think it's time to clean up the python scripts and switch the main repo to the dotnet tools.
