This week I did some work on my synth project, starting to refactor the keyboard
input from the actual sound synth so I can play with midi input some time in
the future. I also made a skateboarding, mail delivery game for the gmtk2018 game
jam called [Skate and die](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018/rate/299793).
The name is obviously a nod to the classic "Skate or die" but what can you do
when you get an idea that absolutly must be created?
