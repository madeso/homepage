This week I continued work on updating the genesis 3d api, but most of the week have been spent on writing a god awful script to download AltDevBlogADay from wayback machine and replacing archive with modern links where it makes sense. There is some small extraction left to be done but I think the next major thing will be merging several mirrors, since apart from being slow apparently wayback also haven't mirrored everything (404 errors happen). It could be that the page was in a bad state when it was mirrored, who knows...
