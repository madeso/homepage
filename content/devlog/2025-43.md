This week I did some work on poster tester and upgraded dear imgui to lastest for klotter. While the upgrade took a while (I was years behind) I still managed to start on rendering the textures in gamma space (again). While I could live without gamma correct textures, rendering depth is something I "need" and that will be done after gamma corrected textures is completed, hopefully next week...
