This week I continued on the altdev archive. I converted the last html to markdown yesterday and it's looking fine. Some small manual cleanup remains. Current step is to algorithmically remove duplicates and it basically consists of looking at various duplicates and see if I can detect and fix patterns early on. Then, and hopefully I can start on this before the end of the week, is copying the comment structure to the hugo setup.
