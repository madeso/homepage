Move the cursors away from the red items, charge and explode converting all reds into blue scores that need to be picked up before red can convert them.

Somewhat inspired by a mini game seen from somewhere and it shows. Not really a good game but kinda fun and from concept to implementation was less than a day so that's good I guess.
