So... In my quest to make a complete game with each engine, here is my second game. My first game was made with a homegrown 3d engine in OpenGL with ODE. This one however is in 2d and uses HGE and bass(through HGE). My previous game was made in a month, this was made in a week. The Game The game itself is based on a really old game for the mac that I liked, and I think it was called The 4th dimension, though I can only find a game dev company called 4th dimension. Anyway the game is 4 in a row in 3 dimensions. And as the original it is displayed in 2d. You can play against a friend or the computer(with hard and easy ai). As someone nicely pointed out, this should be played in 3 dimensions, but hey HGE can't so I guess that if I ever remake this, I'll make it in 3d
