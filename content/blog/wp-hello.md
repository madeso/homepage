.. and I’m a game programmer. My best game so far would probably be lolball. A game where you move through levels as fast as possible to get a better score, all while doing as many combos as possible. Did I mention particle effects and slow-motion?
Currently however I’m working on a remake of tetris so I can get a stable codebase for my next progress.

Until next time…
