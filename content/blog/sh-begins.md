So I decided that I need to make a bigger game, a game that I can work on for a
few months at least and not get bored. I shouldn’t have any complicated animations
and should be “easy” to make. A basic renderer on the top of a physics simulation
won’t be that complicated and could be fun.

I thought about remaking a previous game of mine, [lolball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjG1_d7Fxc8&feature=player_detailpage#t=13s), but all the design I
could come up with was way to complicated for what I had imagined. All hope seemed
to be lost and my motivation for creating something was low.

However, last week, I finally cracked the case. I’m going to make a spiritual
remake of [Lander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_%28computer_game%29) by Psygnosis. In it the player controls a lander spaceship
and navigates tight corridors and sometimes shoots down turrets. The twist is
that the only main thruster is directed down so to move around one has to
orient the ship and move around by combining the thruster and gravity.

This should be a perfect game to make and expand upon. Lots of possibilities for
explosions and particles, easy models to make, basic shapes doesn’t detract
from overall look and feel various fun control options and accessories and to
investigate and most importantly it doesn’t seem to be anyone that is actively
making a clone.
