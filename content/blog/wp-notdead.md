Whoa… almost 5 months since last time! I gotta post more than twice a year 🙂

Anyways, I’ve been quite busy since last time:

* My [pwn game library](http://code.google.com/p/pwn-engine/) is still in development.
* and I’ve entered ludum dare twice..

I’ve posted my first entry, let’s go cave exploring, earlier in this blog.
My second entry for the “Explore” theme was “Xplorer – the game” a kinda unfinished
2-player game that ends when everything is explored

And my entry for the “islands” theme, that finished roughly one week ago, was “The Traveling Salesman Problem”
where you are a saleman byuing and selling stuff, trying to avoid pirates and saving your dad.
