I though this is good time to talk and clarify a little about the game and blog title, and how misleading that title might be.

First and foremost the game is not set in space. The game might take place on different planets and you might travel from these places, but this is not part of the game.

Neither is hustling of any kind. You are a soldier/mercenary/technician for hire, you do your job and you get paid, so no hustling whatsoever.

I wanted to name the blog UARC as that is the working title of the crafts (Urban Assault Recon Craft) but that blog is already taken by the actual UARC ([University Affiliated Research Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Affiliated_Research_Center)) and space hustler was a name early on that didn’t fit but stuck nonetheless.

But anyway, space hustler is a working title. What will the final game be named? I don’t know.

Any ideas?
