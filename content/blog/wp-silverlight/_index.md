I recently had to install silverlight at my computer(channel 9 required it), since I wanted to have a look at the brand new Visual Studio 2010 without downloading that huge ctp, and I must say that I really liked the installation process. Unlike most installations it doesn’t force you to press 20 buttons to install it. Only 2, ” install now”, and “close”.  It actually felt refreshing.

It still manages to mention silverlight 4 times though without telling you what it does. Still, it’s [better than Java](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/12.html).
