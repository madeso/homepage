Since last time I’ve entered [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) and actually [finished](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?uid=1135) at 75ths place and a bronze in community – yay me.

Since then I’ve integrated the half/16-bit float from the glorious [OpenEXR-project](http://www.openexr.com/) into my game-library [pwn](http://code.google.com/p/pwn-engine/).

I’ve also been thinking about creating a 2d level editor as editing text-files suck, and there doesn’t seem to be a good
level-editor. Most of the 2d level editors are focused on tile-based editing, but I want a more free-flow sprite-based editor,
like the [aquaria editor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsT6otdcTv0)(nicely captured by [wolfire design tour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BpRsjF7QTM)) or the boingo editor that is briefly visible in their [sga trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuqSnmseWkI).
Preferably I like the editor to be integrate-able with [box2d](http://www.box2d.org/) (so that it generates the collision geometry).
