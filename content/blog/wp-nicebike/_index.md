So my bicycle have been trashed for some time now. Since Thursday actually. It really isnt a big deal unless I was attending No More Sweden and bicycle is my only viable transportation. I might have to rent one if it doesnâ€™t get finished. It was actually supposed to be finished this Monday, but they are missing spare parts. Thatâ€™s right, I bike hard.

Though my extreme/hard-biking might be beacuse Iâ€™m so

Considering my transportation the hardcore game-development, that I entered at the start of this week, hasnâ€™t taken a all that serious blow. Yes I am behind schedule, but not that much. Considering I only had a black screen with no code whatsoever and I now have a almost complete level-loading, collision-detection and game-state code I am might proud ðŸ˜‰
