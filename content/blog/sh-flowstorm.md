I attended the [nordic game indie night](http://nordicgame.com/?id=73), and got to play [flowstorm](http://www.flowstormgame.com/) (that did
a [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/740665854/flowstorm)) and
realized 2 things: It’t a really hard game and that it’s also a lander-like 2d game.
Check it out if you haven’t already.
