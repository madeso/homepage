So Iâ€™m attending this game-jam called [No more sweden](http://www.nomoresweden.com/nms-2009/)(funny name) this week. Wednesday/Thursday to Saturday/Sunday. Iâ€™ll be attending most of it, though I have to work at Thursday and Friday, which is a bummer,  so Ive been thinking at what kind of game Iâ€™m be making. Iâ€™ve been thinking about making a simple plat former for some time now, and this might be good time as any to make it a reality.

I think Iâ€™ve chosen my tools. C# as the programming language for itâ€™s rapid development time, sfml.net for it easiness (actually Iâ€™m forced to compile it since the official distribution was missing some things though the C++ version is the best 2d/OpenGL launcher library) and tiled for itâ€™s easy-loadable data and unfriendliness.

Since any preparations is allowed Iâ€™m gonna jump-start and code that plat-former starting today, I might have a huge merge-problem when I get my topics, but thatâ€™s a problem for future gustav ðŸ™‚

On a small side-note, my aggregator tells me that I got ~200 unread items, most of them are [lifehackerposts](http://lifehacker.com/). Iâ€™ve been postponing the unavoidable and I think should read some of them â€“ soon. I just gotta do this first ðŸ˜‰
