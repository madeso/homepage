It’s been a while since I posted, but I have been buried deep in rift and input
development. Rift development is pretty much done and I have rift support. I
have received my [razer hydra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razer_Hydra) and backed the stem system and I’m hoping I’ll
receive my [sixense stem](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/89577853/stem-system-the-best-way-to-interact-with-virtual) system in July.
