I recently came to the conclusion that I wont continue tetris, and instead restart my third person shooter-beatemup zombie & soldier slayfest Survivors. I always knew I was going back to survivors, I just didnâ€™t know that I was going to give up on tetris. In reality it has to do with I got bored and canâ€™t come up with  a satisfying way of designing the menys. It sucks really, but all of the time wont go to waste since most of the code is basic boilerplate and Iâ€™m happy with most of the layout.

In researching the fighting/beatemup part of the game Iâ€™ve made a small application that parses a combo-list and generates a graphviz compatible combo-tree. Basically what it tells me that ninja gaiden has a maximum node-depth of roughly 6 combos while oni has a depth of 3, so close to nothing ðŸ™‚
