This week instead of talking just design I thought I would be nice to share some development ideas that I’ve been brewing for a while, and it has to do with distribution of the game. The obvious choice is steam, and probably the equivalent to the appstore on ubuntu(if that still exists and is flourishing), but a part of me wants to sell the game to all linux distributions and I can’t test that at all.

The obvious solution for me is to let the others port the game for free, and by game I mean the engine running all the game specific scripts and reading the game specific data as I plan to actually only sell the content, the game/engine running the content is open source. While I haven’t decided on a license, though I’m thinking LGPL, GPL or something close, it’s pretty early on in development, and nothing game like can be seen it is [available over at github](https://github.com/sirGustav/euphoria).
